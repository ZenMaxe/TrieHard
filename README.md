# TrieHard
A playground for building an efficient key prefix lookup collection and comparing various common alternatives.

The .NET Class library does not contain a collection for implementing efficient user autocomplete operations or prefix searching
records by a key, despite these being very common operations.

*While the name of the repository has "Trie" in it, this repository is not limited to testing implementations of tries.*
